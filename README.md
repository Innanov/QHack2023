## QHack Open Hackathon

Share your ideas with the quantum world at QHack's famous open hackathon!

This year's hackathon includes new sponsored challenges, each with unique prizes. Your project will be eligible for multiple prizes that fit the proposed topics. 

See below for challenge topics and additional eligibility criteria. Complete details for prize eligibility is available in the [2023 QHack Terms & Conditions](https://qhack.ai/terms-and-conditions/).

### How do I take part?


To submit your team's entry for any of these prizes, you should follow these steps:

1. Create a folder called `project_<name of your team>` with you hackathon project and zip it.


2. Create an issue in this repository following this [template](https://github.com/XanaduAI/QHack2023/issues/4).


3. If you are applying for a power up and therefore, it is not yet the final project, indicate this by adding the `PowerUp` label.


4. If, on the other hand, it is the final project, you must add the `Done` label. Do not make the modification on the `PowerUp` issue, create a new issue for that.

And that's it, as easy as that! 
Make sure you do not make any changes to the issue after the closing date or it will not be evaluated.

### What hackathon project should my team do?

The QHack Open Hackathon is open-ended. The choice of topic is completely up to you! 
You could brainstorm a new idea with your team, or start from one of the following seed ideas:

- Implement a idea from the quantum literature—or from one of our guest speaker presentations—in code


- Create a self-contained tutorial or demonstration of an idea from quantum computing (and submit it the 
[PennyLane Community page](https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos_community.html)!)


- Extend one of the [QHack Coding Challenge](Coding_Challenges.md) problems in a novel or interesting way


- Repurpose one of the [PennyLane demos](https://pennylane.ai/qml/demonstrations.html) to run on a quantum hardware device 


- Submit a Pull Request to an open-source library with a new feature

All entries are subject to the QHack [Terms & Conditions](https://qhack.ai/terms-and-conditions/).

### What is the judging criteria for ranking the Open Hackathon projects?

The QHack organizing team will grade every Open Hackathon submission based on three criteria:

- Scientific and/or technical ability demonstrated.
- Overall quality of presentation.
- Depth of use of the quantum computing software and hardware stack.

Specific Open Hackathon Challenges may be judged by that Challenge's sponsors. The QHack organizing team will provide the sponsor with a ranked list of the top candidate projects that are eligible for that Challenge. The final winner will be chosen by the sponsor from this list of top candidates.

Good luck!
